**City Kabob**  has been a family run and operated restaurant since 2003. Owner and chef, Hossein Gholami, prides himself on providing his customers with quality and authenticity. He has put his spin on popular Persian dishes both he and his wife learned growing up. While many places nowadays take the easy route by pre-cooking their kabobs, here at City Kabob, everything is made to order. All our rice, salad, and marinated meat is prepared each morning.
